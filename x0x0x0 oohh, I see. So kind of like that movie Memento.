people are numbers

fine mist while cascading numbers tumbled into place
until they were frozen in the git commit, never to be heard again.

Hello everyone, welcome to another edition of Committed, the
show where we interview people who should be, um, interviewed!
Today's guest is the author of the story you've just read. So please
welcome Rob Nugen

(applause)

Thank you for coming, Mr Nugen.

Oh, please just call me Rob.

Well thank you Rob.  How does it feel to have finished such a great book?

Well, I guess I could say I am optimistic, looking forward to hearing
that people enjoy the story.

Obviously they do; otherwise we would not have secured this interview

Umm

Is there anyone you would like to thank for helping, or for inspiration?

Certainly!  First to Travis, my one and only reader (haha), who has

Bullshit, where they released some of their lesser know music.

Yes, and some might say unreleasable, which you will soon see what I mean.

How were you able to create the story arc for the protagonist?  It's
simply brilliant work.

Trust me, I have no idea.  I am afraid you shouldn't even ask such
questions or you might jinx it.

How's that?

Look, don't you see?  I literally have not. written. the. story.  I
mean, I plan to, but writing it backwards is going to be challenging,
and darn near impossible.

Backwards?

Yes, like this interview.  Look at the dates on the commit messages.

oohh, I see. So kind of like that movie Memento.

Yes. Exactly.  I don't know what the reader has already read, given
that the reader is reading the writing of this interview after having
