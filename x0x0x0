Hello everyone, welcome to another edition of Committed, the
show where we interview people who should be, um, interviewed!
Today's guest is the author of the story you've just read. So please
welcome Rob Nugen

(applause)

Thank you for coming, Mr Nugen.

Oh, please just call me Rob.

Well thank you Rob.  How does it feel to have finished such a great book?

Well, I am not sure what you mean by finished, but I guess I could say
I am optimistic, looking forward to finishing and hopefully hearing
that people enjoy the story.

Obviously they do; otherwise we would not have secured this interview
with you.

Umm

Is there anyone you would like to thank for helping, or for inspiration?

Certainly!  First to Travis, my one and only reader (haha), who has
helped me with countless hours of computery stuff.

Yes that is great to have such dedicated fans.  I heard he was part of the reason you moved to Japan.

Ah yes that is true!  He and I met back at Rice University as DJs.  I really liked his relaxed, funny, friendly demeanor.  I don't remember specifically talking about going to Japan, but he gave me invaluable advice for learning Japanese.

What was that advice?

To learn the syllabary first, instead of relying on romanization of
Japanese words.

Good advice!  I will keep that in mind if I decide to learn Japanese.
Anyway, did you say you were DJs?

Well, we were not professionals, but we volunteered as DJs at Rice
University's radio station, KTRU, back when it was 91.7.

Sounds fun!  But sorry, I interrupted you.  You were speaking about
people who had inspired you.

Yes, there is also Michael John Grist, the author of The Saint's Rise,
THE LAST, and the rest of the Zombie Ocean series.  I want to thank
him for being such an inspiring writer.

Next is Jimmy who shares my future plans to be a mogul so we can just do fun projects all day.

Oh, and of course my brother
Dr Nooj who I miss dearly!  Curiously, Fred finished his PhD during
this interview.  That's just to give you a sense of the timing.

Interesting.  Tell us about your brother.

We are quite close and appreciate the same type of humor and inside
jokes.  He's much more fashionable than I am, plus a whole lot
smarter, but I'm older, and always will be.  We chat for hours and
then my wife asks me specific questions about his life.  I have to
tell her I have no idea; we didn't talk about that!  Sometimes we work
on projects online or play Minecraft together.  Well, once or twice a
year, around the holidays.  Oh speaking of family, I should thank Ma
and Dad as well.  Man. I should call them.  brb.

That is fine.  We can wait.

Okay, I am back.  They are doing well.  Really great to be in touch with them.  My brother is doing a really cool project; he has a profile page online!

Nice!  Do you want to do a shout out?

Uh, yeah, uhh..  h t t p s colon slash slash w w w dot e v e n t b r i
t e dot com slash o slash d r hyphen f r e d hyphen n u g e n hyphen
one six five eight six six seven five six three ... that's all.  Oh
wait, that is for his C++ course.  Here it is: bmemc dot com.  I guess
I should update my records with his correct domain sometime.

Ah good.  Very glad to hear it.  Now let's see.  Oh, you were talking
about your friends and family who have supported you.

Man there are just too many to say and I will probably forget
some. Just ask the NSA for my friends list.

Hahaha.

No, but seriously, I have been saving the best for last,
my wife Lin, who is simply amazing and great support in all aspects of
my life.  I love you Babychan!  Boooof!

Haha so cute.

I can't really help it.

Can we look forward to any future work?

Well I have already written a fair few jokes, junk, throwaway
thoughts, and some meta content in the commit messages so that will
certainly be available.  I guess it's like the 1994 Beastie Boy's
album, Some Old Bullsh*t.

Oh, you don't have to censor that.  You're referring to Some Old
B*llshit, on which they released some of their lesser known music.

Yes, and some might say unreleasable, which you will soon see what I mean.

How were you able to create the story arc for the protagonist?  It's
simply brilliant work.

Trust me, I have no idea.  I am afraid you shouldn't even ask such
questions or you might jinx it.

How's that?

Look, don't you see?  I literally have not. written. the. story.  I
mean, I plan to, but writing it backwards is going to be challenging,
and darn near impossible.

Backwards?

Yes, like this interview.  Look at the dates on the commit messages.

Oohh, I see. So kind of like the film Memento by Christopher Nolan.

Yes. Exactly.  I don't know what the reader has already read, given
that the reader is reading the writing of this interview after having
