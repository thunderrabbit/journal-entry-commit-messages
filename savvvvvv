Well thank you Rob.  How does it feel to have finished such a great book?

Trust me, I have no idea.  I am afraid you shouldn't even ask such

How's that?

Look, don't you see?  I literally have not. written. the. story.  I

and darn near impossible.

Backwards?

Yes, like this interview.  Look at the dates on the commit messages.

oohh, So kind of like that movie Momento.

Yes. Exactly.  I don't know what the reader has already read, given
that the reader is reading the writing of this interview after having
